DELIVERABLE 1 (D1) 

PROBLEM 1 [10 MARKS]  
Using the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) approach (or one of its extensions), present one goal specific to METRICSTICS and articulate 2N questions related to that goal, where N is the team size. 
Discuss whether any metrics help answer those questions.  

NOTES 
The goals must aim to be SMART.   

PROBLEM 2 [30 MARKS]  
Using the given description, construct a use case model for METRICSTICS. This construction must be accompanied by definitions of actors and use cases, and descriptions of use case scenarios.  

NOTES  
There can be several use cases, including carrying out a sequence of calculations, saving data in memory, restarting a session, and so on.
A statistical calculator1 could be used as a motivation to ‘elicit’ necessary use cases.
