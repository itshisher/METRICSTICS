# METRICSTICS
METRICSTICS (a portmanteau of METRICS and STATISTICS) is a system for finding m, M, o, d, μ, MAD, and σ. The system must take as input a random number of data values and output its descriptive statistics. <br><br>
The purpose of the project is to create a set of interrelated artifacts for conducting certain measurements related to METRICSTICS.  <br><br>

Let x be a random variable that can take values from a finite data set x1, x2, x3, ..., xn, with each value having the same probability.  <br>
The minimum, m, is the smallest of the values in the given data set. (m need not be unique.) <br>
The maximum, M, is the largest of the values in the given data set. (M need not be unique.)  <br>
The mode, o, is the value that appears most frequently in the given data set. (o need not be unique.)  <br>
The median, d, is the middle number if n is odd, and is the arithmetic mean of the two middle numbers if n is even.  <br>
The arithmetic mean, μ. <br>
The mean absolute deviation, MAD.	<br>
The standard deviation, σ. <br>

<h3>PROBLEM 1 [10 MARKS] </h3>
Using the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) approach (or one of its extensions), present one goal specific to METRICSTICS and articulate 2N questions related to that goal, where N is the team size. Discuss whether any metrics help answer those questions. <br><br>
NOTES  <br>
The goals must aim to be SMART. <br><br>

<h3>PROBLEM 2 [30 MARKS] </h3>
Using the given description, construct a use case model for METRICSTICS. This construction must be accompanied by definitions of actors and use cases, and descriptions of use case scenarios.  <br><br>
NOTES <br>
There can be several use cases, including carrying out a sequence of calculations, saving data in memory, restarting a session, and so on. A statistical calculator1 could be used as a motivation to ‘elicit’ necessary use cases. <br>

<h3>System Documetation</h3>
Our system used object-orientation as the programming paradigm and Python as the programming language. The implementation of graphical user interface for METRICSTICS is using Tkinter. The main project includes eight python files, several csv files which are dataset generated by the system and results calculated by the system, also a log file which logs all the information while the system is running. The system is initialized by running the main.py.  
<br><br>
The system requires to connecte to the local database to use the signin and signup functionalities. Users can choose guest mode to perform calculations on descriptive statistics.

  <h3>Summary of Statistical Methods</h3> 

  <h4><code>calculateMin(self)</code></h4> 
  <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Computes the minimum value within a dataset using a divide-and-conquer recursive approach.</p> 
  <p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Recursively divides the dataset into segments, compares minimum values, and returns the overall minimum.</p> 
  
  <h4><code>calculateMax(self)</code></h4> 
  <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Computes the maximum value within a dataset using a divide-and-conquer recursive approach.</p> 
  <p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Recursively divides the dataset into segments, compares maximum values, and returns the overall maximum.</p> 
  
  <h4><code>calculateMean(self)</code></h4> 
  <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Calculates the mean (average) value of a dataset using a divide-and-conquer recursive approach.
  </p> <p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Recursively divides the dataset into segments, calculates sums and counts, and computes the mean.</p> 
  
  <h4><code>calculateMode(self)</code></h4> 
  <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Determines the mode (most frequent value) within a dataset.</p>
  <p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Uses a dictionary to count frequencies of elements and identifies the mode(s) with the highest frequency.</p> 
  
  <h4><code>calculateMedian(self)</code></h4>
  <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Calculates the median (middle value) of a dataset efficiently using the Quick Select algorithm.</p> 
  <p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Utilizes Quick Select to find the middle value(s) without fully sorting the dataset.</p> 
  
  <h4><code>calculateMAD(self)</code></h4> 
  <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Computes the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a dataset using the mean value calculated previously.</p>
  <p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Computes the absolute differences between each data point and the mean, then calculates the mean of these absolute differences.</p> 
  
  <h4><code>calculateSD(self)</code></h4> 
  <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Computes the Standard Deviation of a dataset.</p> 
  <p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Calculates the variance incrementally and computes the standard deviation as the square root of the variance.</p>
