# METRICSTICS
METRICSTICS (a portmanteau of METRICS and STATISTICS) is a system for finding m, M, o, d, μ, MAD, and σ. The system must take as input a random number of data values and output its descriptive statistics. <br><br>
The purpose of the project is to create a set of interrelated artifacts for conducting certain measurements related to METRICSTICS.  <br><br>

Let x be a random variable that can take values from a finite data set x1, x2, x3, ..., xn, with each value having the same probability.  <br>
The minimum, m, is the smallest of the values in the given data set. (m need not be unique.) <br>
The maximum, M, is the largest of the values in the given data set. (M need not be unique.)  <br>
The mode, o, is the value that appears most frequently in the given data set. (o need not be unique.)  <br>
The median, d, is the middle number if n is odd, and is the arithmetic mean of the two middle numbers if n is even.  <br>
The arithmetic mean, μ. <br>
The mean absolute deviation, MAD.	<br>
The standard deviation, σ. <br>

<h3>PROBLEM 1 [10 MARKS] </h3>
Using the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) approach (or one of its extensions), present one goal specific to METRICSTICS and articulate 2N questions related to that goal, where N is the team size. Discuss whether any metrics help answer those questions. <br><br>
NOTES  <br>
The goals must aim to be SMART. <br><br>

<h3>PROBLEM 2 [30 MARKS] </h3>
Using the given description, construct a use case model for METRICSTICS. This construction must be accompanied by definitions of actors and use cases, and descriptions of use case scenarios.  <br><br>
NOTES <br>
There can be several use cases, including carrying out a sequence of calculations, saving data in memory, restarting a session, and so on. A statistical calculator1 could be used as a motivation to ‘elicit’ necessary use cases. <br>
